An array is a basic data structure to store a collection of elements 
sequentially. But elements can be accessed randomly since each element in
the array can be identified by an array index.

An array can have one or more dimensions. 
Here we start with the one-dimensional array,
which is also called the linear array. Here is an example:

In the above example, there are 6 elements in array A.
That is to say, the length of A is 6.
We can use A[0] to represent the first element in the array.
Therefore, A[0] = 6. 
Similarly, A[1] = 3, 
A[2] = 8 and so on.

As we mentioned in the previous article, an array has a fixed capacity and we
need to specify the size of the array when we initialize it.
Sometimes this will be somewhat inconvenient and wasteful.

Therefore, most programming languages offer built-in dynamic array
which is still a random access list data structure but with variable size.
For example, we have vector in C++ and *ArrayList* in Java.
